# ScratchScript
ScratchScript is a javascript-like programming language that compiles to Scratch projects (.sb3)

It uses ANTLR4 for tokenizing/parsing and has an IR language that converts assembly-like commands to Scratch blocks.

## WARNING
This project is very early in development. Current code can cause eye damage, proceed with caution.

I promise to write a better README if this project develops any further.
